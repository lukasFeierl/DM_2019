# DiSH Algorithm 

This is a python implementation of the DiSH algorithm.

    Contents:
        ./datasets    ... containing test datasets
        ./DiSH_python ... contains the python implementation of DiSH including some test files
        DiSH Documentation.pdf ... Main documentation file for DiSH


Documentation:
--------------
For the documentation of the algorithm please look at the DiSH Documentation.pdf, 
the comments in the code, or try to run some file in the "test" directory.


RUN the Code:
-------------
You can find the main implementation of DiSH in ./DiSH_python/dish_main.py.

By running dish_main.py as "main"-file in python3 
you can see how DiSH performs on the mouse.csv dataset.

(It is assumed that you have the dataset in the directory: ./datasets/mouse.csv)

    Tested on Python3 on Windows10 with Pycharm IDE and Spyder IDE
