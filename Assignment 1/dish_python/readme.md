DiSH Algorithm !
--------

For the documentation of the algorithm please look at the comments in the code,
the DiSH.pdf or you can try to run some file in the "test" directory.

You can find the main implementation of DiSH in dish.py.

By running dish.py as "main" you can see how DiSH performs on the mouse.csv dataset.
It is assumed that you have the dataset in the directory:
    ../datasets/mouse.csv

    Tested on Python3 on Windows10 with Pycharm IDE and Spyder IDE
